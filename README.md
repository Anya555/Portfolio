#React Portfolio

For this project I've created my personal web portfolio using React js library. It's a multi page website that has information about me, projects I've been working on and contact page. It's been a great experience, sometimes a bit challenging.


#Technologies and libraries

This website is built on React Bootstrap that I used for CSS grid, layouts and bootstrap components. Layouts are responsive on all screen sizes. 

To make website more live I was working with animation libraries: React animations and AOS(animate on scroll). AOS definitely  has more advantage because of it's built in animation on scroll functionality.

For navigation between components I've been working with React-Router-Dom library.

I wanted to have a separate page with a contact form, where anyone can directly send me an email. I used Email JS library, which was fairly easy to use and it does not require backend.

I also added like button and scroll up button to my website. In the near future I'm also planning to make my personal blog, where I can share some of my experience.
